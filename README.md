# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

Hi, 
My name is Rikku joseph an aspiring, to-be data analyst. This is a collection of all the data analysis projects that I have done.(LinkedIn Profile : [Rikku joseph](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rikkujoseph/))

I started out my data analysis journey by enrolling and completing the "Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate" course. My first full-fledged
data analysis project was its capstone project. The entire analysis was done using R Programming language on R Studio. A detailed decription regarding all the underlying process, along with the code and the analysis report can be viewed on my Kaggle account by [clicking here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rikkujoseph/data-analytics-project)

The next project that I embarked on was the analysis of Covid data using SQL. The data used spans from January of 2020 to August of 2022. It uses fundamental concepts in SQL to sort, organize and view key insights about the Covid-19 Pandemic. The **SQL Query** for this project and more details about it can be viewed [here](https://github.com/RikkuJoseph/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/CovidData.sql). The data required was downloaded from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/). The dataset used is added to this repository namely [CovidDeaths.csv](https://github.com/RikkuJoseph/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/CovidDeaths.csv) and [CovidVaccinations.csv](https://github.com/RikkuJoseph/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/CovidVaccinations.csv). 

A Effective **Tableau Visualization** of the Covid Data's insights can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rikku.joseph/viz/CovidDataDashboard_16605554413170/Dashboard1)

Another project that expanded my skillset in SQL is the SQL Data Cleaning project. It uses some advanced SQL concepts for cleaning the dataset under consideration.The **SQL query** can be viewed [here](https://github.com/RikkuJoseph/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20Project.sql) along with more details. The dataset used is data on [Nashville Housing market](https://github.com/RikkuJoseph/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx).

The next one in my portfolio is a **Spreadsheet Project**. This fun project demonstrates day to day activities done by a data analyst on an Excel data file. It can be viewed by clicking [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FSpGGRjW2B6d5yqeT_gtJHE1105l9MTz4VkX8sX1Evc/edit?usp=sharing) and also is stored in this repo under the file name Spreadsheet Project.xlsx .

As an end to my search for finding real world data analytics project, I came across **Flipside Crypto**, A cryptocurrecny data analytics platform that motivates community members to create analysis and Dashboards using their Databases on crypto. I would like to share two of my projects from the space right here [[1]](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/sol-to-usdc-volume-on-orca-vs-jupiter-from-feb-01-to-feb-28-2022-LA-NRy) [[2]](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/flipping-nf-ts-skill-building-bounty-6-hard-z6BglL). I am also sharing my personal projects folder [here](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Rikku%20Joseph) on the website where all my new works on the platform will be reflected.
