# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

Hi, 
My name is Rikku joseph an aspiring, to-be data analyst. This is a collection of all the data analysis projects that I have done.

I started out my data analysis journey by enrolling and completing the "Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate" course. My first full-fledged
data analysis project was its capstone project. The entire analysis was done using R Programming language on R Studio. A detailed decription regarding all the underlying process, along with the code and the analysis report can be viewed on my Kaggle account by [clicking here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rikkujoseph/data-analytics-project)

The next project that I embarked on was the analysis of Covid data using SQL. It is an analysis of covid data from January of 2020 to August of 2022 using SQL. It uses fundamental concepts in SQL to sort, organize and view key insights about the Covid-19 Pandemic. The SQL Query for this project and more details about it can be viewed [here](https://github.com/RikkuJoseph/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/CovidData.sql). The data required was downloaded from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/). The dataset used is added to this repo namely [CovidDeaths.csv](https://github.com/RikkuJoseph/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/CovidDeaths.csv) and [CovidVaccinations.csv](https://github.com/RikkuJoseph/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/CovidVaccinations.csv). 
A Effective Tableau Visualization of this project's insights can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rikku.joseph/viz/CovidDataDashboard_16605554413170/Dashboard1)
